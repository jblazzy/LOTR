      "In that time were made those things that afterwards \n",
      "were most renowned of all the works of the Elves. For \n",
      "Feanor, being come to his full might, was filled with a new \n",
      "thought, or it may be that some shadow of foreknowledge \n",
      "came to him of the doom that drew near; and he pondered \n",
      "how the light of the Trees, the glory of the Blessed Realm, \n",
      "might be preserved imperishable. Then he began a long \n",
      "and secret labour, and he summoned all his lore, and his \n",

      "comes no more among his kin; not until the Sun passes \n",
      "and the Moon falls, shall it be known of what substance they \n",
      "were made. Like the crystal of diamonds it appeared, and \n",
      "yet was more strong than adamant, so that no violence \n",
      "could mar it or break it within the Kingdom of Arda. Yet that \n",
      "crystal was to the Silmarils but as is the body to the \n",
      "Children of lluvatar: the house of its inner fire, that is within it \n",
      "and yet in all parts of it, and is its life. And the inner fire of \n",
      "the Silmarils Feanor made of the blended light of the Trees \n",
      "of Valinor, which lives in them yet, though the Trees have \n",
      "long withered and shine no more. Therefore even in the \n",
      "darkness of the deepest treasury the Silmarils of their own \n",
      "radiance shone like the stars of Varda; and yet, as were \n",
      "they indeed living things, they rejoiced in light and received \n",
      "it and gave it back in hues more marvellous than before. \n",
      "\n",
      "All who dwelt in Aman were filled with wonder and \n",
      "delight at the work of Feanor. And Varda hallowed the \n",
      "Silmarils, so that thereafter no mortal flesh, nor hands \n",
      "unclean, nor anything of evil will might touch them, but it was \n",
      "scorched and withered; and Mandos foretold that the fates \n",
      "of Arda, earth, sea, and air, lay locked within them. The \n",
      "heart of Feanor was fast bound to these things that he \n",
      "himself had made. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "memory of their radiance was a gnawing fire in his heart. \n",
      "From that time forth, inflamed by this desire, he sought ever \n",
      "more eagerly how he should destroy Feanor and end the \n",
      "friendship of the Valar and the Elves; but he dissembled his \n",
      "purposes with cunning, and nothing of his malice could yet \n",
      "be seen in the semblance that he wore. Long was he at \n",
      "work, and slow at first and barren was his labour. But he \n",
      "that sows lies in the end shall not lack of a harvest, and \n",
      "soon he may rest from toil indeed while others reap and \n",
      "sow in his stead. Ever Melkor found some ears that would \n",
      "heed him, and some tongues that would enlarge what they \n",
      "had heard; and his lies passed from friend to friend, as \n",
      "secrets of which the knowledge proves the teller wise. \n",
      "Bitterly did the Noldor atone for the folly of their open ears \n",
      "in the days that followed after. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw that many leaned towards him, Melkor \n",
      "would often walk among them, and amid his fair words \n",
      "others were woven, so subtly that many who heard them \n",
      "believed in recollection that they arose from their own \n",
      "thought. Visions he would conjure in their hearts of the \n",
      "mighty realms that they could have ruled at their own will, in \n",
      "power and freedom in the East; and then whispers went \n",
      "abroad that the Valar had brought the Eldar to Aman \n",
      "because of their jealousy, fearing that the beauty of the \n",
      "Quendi and the makers' power that lluvatar had \n",
      "bequeathed to them would grow too great for the Valar to \n",
      "govern, as the Elves waxed and spread over the wide lands \n",
      "of the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "In those days, moreover, though the Valar knew indeed \n",
      "of the coming of Men that were to be, the Elves as yet knew \n",
      "naught of it; for Manwe had not revealed it to them. Bat \n",
      "Melkor spoke to them in secret of Mortal Men, seeing how \n",
      "the silence of the Valar might be twisted to evil. Little he \n",
      "knew yet concerning Men, for engrossed with his own \n",
      "thought in the Music he had paid small heed to the Third \n",
      "Theme of lluvatar; but now the whisper went among the \n",
      "Elves that Manwe held them captive, so that Men might \n",
      "come and supplant them in the kingdoms of Middle-earth, \n",
      "for the Valar saw that they might more easily sway this \n",
      "short-lived and weaker race, defrauding the Elves of the \n",
      "inheritance of lluvatar. Small truth was there in this, and little \n",
      "have the Valar ever prevailed to sway the wills of Men; but \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "many of the Noldor believed, or half believed, the evil \n",
      "words. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ere the Valar were aware, the peace of Valinor \n",
      "was poisoned. The Noldor began to murmur against them, \n",
      "and many became filled with pride, forgetting how much of \n",
      "what they had and knew came to them in gift from the Valar. \n",
      "Fiercest burned the new flame of desire for freedom and \n",
      "wider realms in the eager heart of Feanor; and Melkor \n",
      "laughed in his secrecy, for to that mark his lies had been \n",
      "addressed, hating Feanor above all, and lusting ever for the \n",
      "Silmarils. But these he was not suffered to approach; for \n",
      "though at great feasts Feanor would wear them, blazing on \n",
      "his brow, at other times they were guarded close, locked in \n",
      "the deep chambers of his hoard in Tirion. For Feanor \n",
      "began to love the Silmarils with a greedy love, and grudged \n",
      "the sight of them to all save to his father and his seven \n",
      "sons; he seldom remembered now that the light within them \n",
      "was not his own. \n",
      "\n",
      "High princes were Feanor and Fingolfin, the elder \n",
      "sons of Finwe, honoured by all in Aman; but now they grew \n",
      "proud and jealous each of his rights and his possessions. \n",
      "Then Melkor set new lies abroad in Eldamar, and whispers \n",
      "came to Feanor that Fingolfin and his sons were plotting to \n",
      "usurp the leadership of Finwe and of the elder line of \n",
      "Feanor, and to supplant them by the leave of the Valar; for \n",
      "the Valar were ill-pleased that the Silmarils lay in Tirion and \n",
      "were not committed to their keeping. But to Fingolfin and \n",
      "Finarfin it was said: 'Beware! Small love has the proud son \n",
      "of Miriel ever had for the children of Indis. Now he has \n",
      "become great, and he has his father in his hand. It will not \n",
      "be long before he drives you forth from Tuna!' \n",
      "\n",
      "And when Melkor saw that these lies were \n",
      "smouldering, and that pride and anger were awake among \n",
      "the Noldor, he spoke to them concerning weapons; and in \n",
      "that time the Noldor began the smithying of swords and \n",
      "axes and spears. Shields also they made displaying the \n",
      "tokens of many houses and kindreds that vied one with \n",
      "another; and these only they wore abroad, and of other \n",
      "weapons they did not speak, for each believed that he \n",
      "alone had received the warning. And Feanor made a \n",
      "secret forge, of which not even Melkor was aware; and \n",
      "there he tempered fell swords for himself and for his sons, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and made tall helms with plumes of red. Bitterly did Mahtan \n",
      "rue the day when he taught to the husband of Nerdanel all \n",
      "the lore of metalwork that he had learned of Aule. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus with lies and evil whisperings and false counsel \n",
      "Melkor kindled the hearts of the Noldor to strife; and of their \n",
      "quarrels came at length the end of the high days of Valinor \n",
      "and the evening of its ancient glory. For Feanor now began \n",
      "openly to speak words of rebellion against the Valar, crying \n",
      "aloud that he would depart from Valinor back to the world \n",
      "without, and would deliver the Noldor from thraldom, if they \n",
      "would follow him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was great unrest in Tirion, and Finwe was \n",
      "troubled; and he summoned all his lords to council. But \n",
      "Fingolfin hastened to his halls and stood before him, \n",
      "saying: 'King and father, wilt thou not restrain the pride of \n",
      "our brother, Curufinwe, who is called the Spirit of Fire, all \n",
      "too truly? By what right does he speak for all our people, as \n",
      "if he were King? Thou it was who long ago spoke before \n",
      "the Quendi, bidding them accept the summons of the Valar \n",
      "to Aman. Thou it was that led the Noldor upon the long road \n",
      "through the perils of Middle-earth to the light of Eldamar. If \n",
      "thou dost not now repent of it, two sons at least thou hast to \n",
      "honour thy words.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But even as Fingolfin spoke, Feanor strode into the \n",
      "chamber, and he was fully armed: his high helm upon his \n",
      "head, and at his side a mighty sword. 'So it is, even as I \n",
      "guessed,' he said. 'My half-brother would be before me with \n",
      "my father, in this as in all other matters.' Then turning upon \n",
      "Fingolfin he drew his sword, crying: 'Get thee gone, and \n",
      "take thy due place!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Fingolfin bowed before Finwe, and without word or \n",
      "glance to Feanor he went from the chamber. But Feanor \n",
      "followed him, and at the door of the king's house he stayed \n",
      "him; and the point of his bright sword he set against \n",
      "Fingolfin's breast 'See, half-brother!' he said. 'This is \n",
      "sharper than thy tongue. Try but once more to usurp my \n",
      "place and the love of my father, and maybe it will rid the \n",
      "Noldor of one who seeks to be the master of thralls.' \n",
      "\n",
      "These words were heard by many, for the house of \n",
      "Finwe was in the great square beneath the Mindon; but \n",
      "again Fingolfin made no answer, and passing through the \n",
      "throng in silence he went to seek Finarfin his brother. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the unrest of the Noldor was not indeed hidden \n",
      "from the Valar, but its seed had been sown in the dark; and \n",
      "therefore, since Feanor first spoke openly against them, \n",
      "they judged that he was the mover of discontent, being \n",
      "eminent in self-will and arrogance, though all the Noldor had \n",
      "become proud. And Manwe was grieved, but he watched \n",
      "and said no word. The Valar had brought the Eldar to their \n",
      "land freely, to dwell or to depart; and though they might \n",
      "judge departure to be folly, they might not restrain them \n",
      "from it. But now the deeds of Feanor could not be passed \n",
      "over, and the Valar were angered and dismayed; and he \n",
      "was summoned to appear before them at the gates of \n",
      "Valmar, to answer for all his words and deeds. There also \n",
      "were summoned all others who had any part in this matter, \n",
      "or any knowledge of it; and Feanor standing before \n",
      "Mandos in the Ring of Doom was commanded to answer \n",
      "all that was asked of him. Then at last the root was laid \n",
      "bare, and the malice of Melkor revealed; and straightway \n",
      "Tulkas left the council to lay hands upon him and bring him \n",
      "again to judgement. But Feanor was not held guiltless, for \n",
      "he it was that had broken the peace of Valinor and drawn \n",
      "his sword upon his kinsman; and Mandos said to him: \n",
      "Thou speakest of thraldom. If thraldom it be, thou canst not \n",
      "escape it; for Manwe is King of Arda, and not of Aman only. \n",
      "And this deed was unlawful, whether in Aman or not in \n",
      "Aman. Therefore this doom is now made: for twelve years \n",
      "thou shall leave Tirion where this threat was uttered. In that \n",
      "time take counsel with thyself, and remember who and what \n",
      "thou art. But after that time this matter shall be set in peace \n",
      "and held redressed, if others will release thee.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Fingolfin said: 'I will release my brother.' But \n",
      "Feanor spoke no word in answer, standing silent before the \n",
      "Valar. Then he turned and left the council, and departed \n",
      "from Valmar. \n",
      "\n",
      "With him into banishment went his seven sons, and \n",
      "northward in Valinor they made a strong place and treasury \n",
      "in the hills; and there at Formenos a multitude of gems \n",
      "were laid in hoard, and weapons also, and the Silmarils \n",
      "were shut in a chamber of iron. Thither also came Finwe \n",
      "the King, because of the love that he bore to Feanor; and \n",
      "Fingolfin ruled the Noldor in Tirion. Thus the lies of Melkor \n",
      "were made true in seeming, though Feanor by his own \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "deeds had brought this thing to pass; and the bitterness \n",
      "that Melkor had sown endured, and lived still long \n",
      "afterwards between the sons of Fingolfin and Feanor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Melkor, knowing that his devices had been \n",
      "revealed, hid himself and passed from place to place as a \n",
      "cloud in the hills; and Tulkas sought for him in vain. Then it \n",
      "seemed to the people of Valinor that the light of the Trees \n",
      "was dimmed, and the shadows of all standing things grew \n",
      "longer and darker in that time. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that for a time Melkor was not seen again in \n",
      "Valinor, nor was any rumour heard of him, until suddenly he \n",
      "came to Formenos, and spoke with Feanor before his \n",
      "doors. Friendship he feigned with cunning argument, urging \n",
      "him to his former thought of flight from the trammels of the \n",
      "Valar; and he said: 'Behold the truth of all that I have \n",
      "spoken, and how thou art banished unjustly. But if the heart \n",
      "of Feanor is yet free and bold as were his words in Tlrion, \n",
      "then I will aid him, and bring him far from this narrow land. \n",
      "For am I not Vala also? Yea, and more than those who sit in \n",
      "pride in Valimar; and I have ever been a friend to the \n",
      "Noldor, most skilled and most valiant of the people of Arda.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Feanor's heart was still bitter at his humiliation \n",
      "before Mandos, and he looked at Melkor in silence, \n",
      "pondering if indeed he might yet trust him so far as to aid \n",
      "him in his flight. And Melkor, seeing that Feanor wavered, \n",
      "and knowing that the Silmarils held his heart in thrall, said at \n",
      "the last: 'Here is a strong place, and well guarded; but think \n",
      "not that the Silmarils will lie safe in any treasury within the \n",
      "realm of the Valar!' \n",
      "\n",
      "But his cunning overreached his aim; his words \n",
      "touched too deep, and awoke a fire more fierce than he \n",
      "designed; and Feanor looked upon Melkor with eyes that \n",
      "burned through his fair semblance and pierced the cloaks \n",
      "of his mind, perceiving there his fierce lust for the Silmarils. \n",
      "Then hate overcame Feanor's fear, and he cursed Melkor \n",
      "and bade him be gone, saying: 'Get thee gone from my \n",
      "gate, thou jail-crow of Mandos!' And he shut the doors of \n",
      "his house in the face of the mightiest of all the dwellers in \n",
      "Ea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Melkor departed in shame, for he was himself in \n",
      "peril, and he saw not his time yet for revenge; but his heart \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was black with anger. And Finwe was filled with great fear, \n",
      "and in haste he sent messengers to Manwe in Valmar. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Valar were sitting in council before their \n",
      "gates, fearing the lengthening of the shadows, when the \n",
      "messengers came from Formenos. At once Orome and \n",
      "Tulkas sprang up, but even as they set out in pursuit \n",
      "messengers came from Eldamar, telling that Melkor had \n",
      "fled through the Calacirya, and from the hill of Tuna the \n",
      "Elves had seen him pass in wrath as a thundercloud. And \n",
      "they said that thence he had turned northward, for the Teleri \n",
      "in Alqualonde had seen his shadow going by their haven \n",
      "towards Araman. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Melkor departed from Valinor, and for a while the \n",
      "Two Trees shone again unshadowed, and the land was \n",
      "filled with light. But the Valar sought in vain for tidings of \n",
      "their enemy; and as a cloud far off that looms ever higher, \n",
      "borne upon a slow cold wind, a doubt now marred the joy of \n",
